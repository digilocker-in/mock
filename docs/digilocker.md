## Digilocker

Digital Locker is a key initiative under Digital India program. It aims at eliminating the use of physical documents and enables sharing of verified electronic documents across agencies. Digital Locker provides a dedicated personal storage space of 1GB in the cloud to citizens. It will enable various organizations registered on Digital Locker to push certificates of citizens directly in their Digital Locker in electronic format. Citizens can also upload and securely store the scanned copies of legacy documents in Digital Locker. These legacy documents can be electronically signed using eSign facility. A citizen can share these electronic certificates online with various departments and agencies registered on Digital Locker while applying for the services provided by them. Thus, Digital Locker brings the citizens, issuers and requestors on one platform.
